## Getting started with the starter kit

1. Do not use npm to install packages, use yarn. If you want to run `npm install` then delete the `yarn.lock` file and install the packages using npm.
2. Run `yarn dev` to start the development server.
3. If there is error on "/dashboard" route then comment out the proxy setup part on `vite.config.ts` file.
